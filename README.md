# Online Blood Bank
> In these tough times, it has become very difficult for people to search for proper blood donors. Many people have lost their near and dear ones due to this problem. We have built our project in such a way that people can visit our website and see the list of blood donors and contact details. They can contact us and also give in the details, which will be directly uploaded on the website by our team.
